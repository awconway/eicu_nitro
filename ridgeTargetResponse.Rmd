library(tidymodels)
```

## Specifications for the ridge model

```{targets specRidgeResponse, tar_simple = TRUE}
  linear_reg(
    penalty = tune(),
    mixture = 0 #Changed from 1 to 0
  ) |>
    set_engine("glmnet")
```

## Grid search to determine the best value for the penaly parameter (i.e. amount of regularization)

```{targets gridRidgeResponse, tar_simple = TRUE }
  dials::grid_regular(dials::penalty(),
    levels = 100
  )
```

## Recipe for the model

Preprocessing steps include normalization, a Yeo-Johnson transformation for variables with many zero values and principal components analysis for the variables that are highly correlated.

**Predictors used here are restricted to those that can be derived from just a medication infusion device and physiolgical monitoring device. Clinical predictors (age, gender, medical conditions etc) were not included.**

```{targets recRidgeResponse, tar_simple = TRUE }
  recipe(sbp_post ~
  sbp_pre +
    nitro_diff_mcg +
    total_nitro +
    n_nitro +
    nitro_time +
     sbp_pre_mean_60 +
     sbp_pre_sd_60 +
    pain_score +
    lag_nitro_diff +
    lag_sbp_diff,
    data = trainingResponse
  ) |>
    step_YeoJohnson(
      n_nitro, nitro_time, total_nitro, sbp_pre_sd_60, pain_score
    ) |>
    step_normalize(
      all_numeric_predictors()
    )|>
    step_pca(
    sbp_pre_mean_60,
    sbp_pre
    ) |> 
  step_interact(terms = ~lag_nitro_diff:lag_sbp_diff) #This is the interaction term

```

## Run the model using 5-fold cross-validation

```{targets workflowRidgeResponse, tar_simple = TRUE}
workflow()|>
    add_recipe(recRidgeResponse)|>
    add_model(specRidgeResponse)
```

```{targets tuningRidgeResponse, tar_simple = TRUE}
    tune_grid(
     workflowRidgeResponse,
      resamples = foldsFiveResponse,
      grid = gridRidgeResponse
    )
```
